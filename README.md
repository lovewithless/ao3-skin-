This skin is designed with <strong>reading comfort</strong> as its priority. It uses a soft
<strong>cream-colored background</strong> with <strong>blue as an accent color</strong>, while the main body
text remains black to support long reading sessions.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by the idea of AO3 as an archive, the works list is styled to resemble
<strong>archival filing cards</strong>. Instead of using heavy color blocks to separate tags,
the layout and spacing are used to keep tags clear without visual clutter,
preserving a paper-like feel.

The statistics area is styled with a <strong>typewriter-style font</strong> and positioned like a
small annotation or footnote on a physical card. Button borders are intentionally
kept minimal to maintain the impression of paper.

<p>
The kudos list is designed to resemble a <strong>library book pocket card</strong>. The kudos
icon appears as a <strong>stamp</strong>, featuring a <strong>California poppy</strong>, the birth flower of
May 17.
</p>

<p>
The stamp-style kudos icon was created with the assistance of AI, due to the lack
of suitable hand-drawn materials.
